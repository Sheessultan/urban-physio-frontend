A modern, responsive frontend for **The Urban Physio** — a digital healthcare platform that helps patients discover physiotherapists and clinics, book appointments, manage treatment packages, and access physiotherapy services online or in person.

Built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**, and deployed on **Cloudflare Pages**.

---

## 📋 Project Overview

**The Urban Physio** connects patients with verified physiotherapists and partner clinics across India. The frontend delivers a fast, mobile-first experience for:

- Browsing doctors and clinics with search, filters, and location-aware listings
- Booking **clinic visits**, **online consultations**, and **home visits**
- Managing appointments, packages, prescriptions, and saved providers
- Role-based dashboards for **patients**, **doctors**, and **administrators**

The app communicates with a REST API backend and is optimized for performance, accessibility, and SEO-friendly public profile pages.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ recommended
- **npm** 9+
- Access to the Urban Physio REST API (local XAMPP or hosted backend)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodeWaveStudio/theurbanphysio.git
cd theurbanphysio/frontend
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory (see [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables)).

### 4. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app runs at **http://localhost:5173** by default. Vite proxies API requests to your local backend when configured.

### 5. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

Output is written to `frontend/dist/`.

### 6. Preview the production build locally

```bash
npm run preview
```

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Create `frontend/.env` (or set variables in **Cloudflare Pages → Settings → Environment variables**):

```env
# REST API base URL (no trailing slash)
VITE_API_URL=https://your-api-domain.com/backend/api

# Google OAuth 2.0 client ID (Web application)
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com

# App base path: /theurbanphysio for local subfolder, empty for production root
VITE_APP_BASE_PATH=/theurbanphysio
```

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `VITE_API_URL` | Recommended | Full URL to the backend API. Falls back to runtime detection if unset in some environments. |
| `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Optional | Enables Google Sign-In when provided. |
| `VITE_APP_BASE_PATH` | Optional | URL base for Vite `base` and dev proxy. Use empty string (`""`) on Cloudflare Pages at domain root. |

> **Note:** Never commit secrets or production `.env` files to version control.

---

## 📜 Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm install` | Install project dependencies |
| `npm run dev` | Start Vite dev server with HMR |
| `npm run build` | Create optimized production build in `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally |

---

## ☁️ Deployment

This frontend is deployed using **Cloudflare Pages**.

**Typical setup:**

1. Connect the GitHub repository to Cloudflare Pages.
2. Set **Root directory** to `frontend` (if monorepo) or repository root (if frontend-only).
3. Configure build settings:
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Build output directory:** `dist`
4. Add environment variables (`VITE_API_URL`, `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `VITE_APP_BASE_PATH=""`).
5. Ensure `public/_redirects` is included so client-side routes work (SPA fallback).

The production site is served globally via Cloudflare’s CDN for low latency and high availability.

---

## ⚡ Performance

- **Vite** for fast cold starts in development and efficient Rollup-based production bundles
- Static asset output under `dist/static/` for cache-friendly delivery
- Lazy-friendly route structure and lightweight API client patterns
- Image and media URL helpers for optimized asset loading
- Cloudflare edge caching for HTML, JS, CSS, and static files

---

## 🔒 Security

- JWT tokens stored in `localStorage` with axios request interceptors
- Role-based route guards (`ProtectedRoute`) for patient, doctor, and admin areas
- Google OAuth for passwordless / social login where enabled
- OTP-based phone and email verification flows
- API errors handled without exposing sensitive server details to end users
- HTTPS enforced in production via Cloudflare

Always keep dependencies updated and rotate API keys and OAuth credentials on a regular schedule.

## 🌐 Browser Support

| Browser | Support |
|---------|---------|
| Chrome (latest) | ✅ Full |
| Firefox (latest) | ✅ Full |
| Safari (latest) | ✅ Full |
| Edge (latest) | ✅ Full |
| Mobile Safari / Chrome | ✅ Optimized |
